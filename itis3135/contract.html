  <h2>Contract</h2>

  <p>
    I, Mayar Alharazi agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
    Spring 2026, ITIS 3135 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
  </p>

  <p>
    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be
    available to the world, and I will not put information there that is inappropriate
    for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or
    showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible
    to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that
    I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except
    where I have properly given credit and never from my classmates.
  </p>
