    <h2>Contract</h2>

    <p>
      I, Mayar Alharazi agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
      Spring 2026, ITIS 3135 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
      I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools
      will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is
      inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also
      understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or
      showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as
      absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this
      class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’
      code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and
      will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit and
      never from my classmates.
    </p>
